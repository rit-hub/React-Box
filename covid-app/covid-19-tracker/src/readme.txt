  //STATE = basically How to write variables in REACT.....
  // const [countries,setCountries] = useState([
  //   'India','USA', 'UK'
  // ]);


  // useEffect = Runs a piece of code based on a given condition
  // the code inside here will run only once when the components loads and not load again until the input [] changes
    // async --> send a request, wait for it, do something with it

// diffrence between map and forEach loop (google it)
